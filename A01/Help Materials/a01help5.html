<H1>W3M Textual Web Browser</H1>
<HR>

<H2>General Information</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Those of you working from home may find that running a graphical web browser such as Firefox remotely is slow.  As an alternative, you may use the w3m text-mode web browser to submit to Marmoset.  The browser is available on the linux.student.cs servers. If you are working at school and you open a terminal after logging into Linux in one of the MC computer labs you should see that linux0xx or mef-linux0xx where xx is some number for the server (ie. mef-linux004) is already the server that you are logged into.
<LI>The mouse works in w3m, even though it's text mode. You can double-click on controls such as text fields and buttons. 
<LI>Type "man w3m" for more detailed instructions on using W3M.

<H2>Assignment Submission Tutorial</H2>
Open a shell(Putty or Cygwin in Windows) and type "ssh linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca" to login to the linux servers from outside of the campus network as seen below. In putty you can enter "linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca" as the Host.<BR>

Open a terminal and login to one of the linux.student.cs computer servers (i.e. linux006).  Note that you may already be logged into a Linux server. Type "w3m https://marmoset.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca" as seen below to open w3m and navigate to the marmoset login webpage.

Use the arrow keys to navigate around the form(or press TAB/shift+TAB).  Navigate over a text field and press ENTER to type text into the field.  Enter your username and password.  Then navigate the cursor over the [LOGIN] button and press enter to continue.

<BR>Navigate the cursor over the File to Submit [] text field and enter in the name of the file.  Note that the current directory is the directory where you executed w3m from.  Once again navigate the cursor over the [Submit project!] button and press enter to submit.<BR> 
<img src="w3m6.jpg"\>
<BR>You should now see a list of submissions.  Your most recent submission will not yet have been tested.  Wait a minute and then refress the screen by navigating the cursor over the AxPy(i.e. A1P1) link and press enter to refresh OR press shift+R.<BR>

<BR>It may be handy to keep multiple terminals open.  One terminal can be open with the text based web browser for submissions and another terminal open to edit assignment work. 
<BR>In order to quit the Marmoset Submission text based web browser, the user can press 'q'.
