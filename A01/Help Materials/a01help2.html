<h2>Unix for <a href=".">CS 241</a> &mdash; The Bare Essentials</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
All CS 241 assignments use the Unix computers of the <a href=http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/student/>CSCF Student Computing Environment</a>.  These are accessed directly
from the CSCF terminal rooms on the 3rd floor of the Math & Computer Building (MC).
<i><p>
In Unix, there are many ways to do everything.  This document describes one way
to do each of the things you need to do the first couple of assignments.  Alternatives
are mentioned in italics.  </p>
</i>
<h3>Logging in and accessing the command line</h3>

<p>Use your WatIAM/Quest user id and password to log in to the lab computers.
(If you can't log in, and you're sure that you are using the correct credentials, you
should speak with a consultant in the <a href=http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/mfcf/help/>MFCF Help Centre</a>
in MC 3017 about your account.) Once you have logged in, you will be presented with a
graphical user interface. You will need to access the command line interface to do
CS 241 course work.</p>

<p>If you are using a Mac, you can run either "X11" or "Terminal". On Linux
machines, look under "Applications" for a program called "Console" or
"Terminal" or something similar. On Solaris machines, there will be a number of
command line windows or "xterms" already open.</p>

<p>To execute a Unix command in a terminal (command-line window), first select the
terminal you want to run the command in. On Solaris, position the mouse cursor
over the appropriate window. On Linux, click on the appropriate window. Then
simply type the command name and press Enter.</p>

<h3>Connecting to a Unix server with SSH</h3>

<p>The Unix-based systems in the labs will allow you to access the files on your
student account and run various standard Unix commands, but they do not
necessarily have all the software you will need to complete your assignments.
To do course work, you will need to connect to another system with the SSH
(Secure SHell) protocol.</p>

<p>There are a number of hosts available in the student computing environment (see
<a href=http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/student/hosts>http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/student/hosts</a>), but it is recommended that you
use one of the <b>linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</b> computers. Other systems may
have different configurations and outdated software, and we cannot guarantee
that the CS 241 course tools will work properly on those systems. If you are
having issues with any of the programs and tools mentioned in lectures or
assignment specifications, make sure you are running them from a
<b>linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</b> host before asking for help.</p>

<p>To connect to a host, execute the following command in a command line window:

<pre>
  <tt><b>ssh -Y linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</b></tt>
</pre>

<i>(The "-Y" part is optional. Including it enables "X11 forwarding", which allows you
to start graphical windowed programs from the terminal.)</i></p>

<p>You will be asked for a username and password; enter your WatIAM/Quest
credentials. Note that unlike many password prompts, the prompt from the <tt><b>ssh</b></tt>
command will not display "*" characters as you type each character of your password, so it
might seem like it's not receiving your keyboard input. However, it is receiving input, so
if you just type your password correctly and hit Enter then you should be able to log in.
Then you should see a command prompt that looks something like this:

<pre>
  <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>

Where "linux028" is the name of the machine you are connected to. You can use
this command prompt to do work on the remote machine just as you would with a
local command line window. The rest of this document will explain some of the
basic commands and tools you will need to know to complete CS 241 assignments.</p>

<p><i>Note: SSH can also be used to access the Unix hosts from any computer with an
internet connection. Thus, if you have an SSH client on your home computer, you
can use SSH to do your course work from home. Any Unix-based computer
(including Macs) will probably already have the <tt><b>ssh</b></tt> command available,
so you just need to open the command line and execute <tt><b>ssh -Y
linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</b></tt> as above. Windows installations normally
do not come with an SSH client, so you will have to install one yourself.
<b>PuTTY</b> is a commonly used free SSH client, and can be downloaded from
<a href=http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>. Another option is to
install <b>Cygwin</b>, a Unix-like environment for Windows that has the
<tt><b>ssh</b></tt> command available.</i></p>

<h3>Unix command line basics</h3>
Note: In this document what you type is shown in <tt><b>bold typewriter font</b></tt>
and what the computer generates is shown in <tt><i>italic typewriter font</i></tt>,
but you won't see any difference on the screen.

Let's try executing a simple Unix command. One such command is <tt><b>date</b></tt> which simply outputs the time and date:

<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>date</b>
   <i>Mon Sep 19 10:56:51 EDT 2011</i>
   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
You can redirect the standard output of a Unix command to a file using <b>></b> (a 'greater than' sign) followed by a name for the file; for example,

<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>date > myfile</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
places the output of the <tt>date</tt> command in the file named <tt>myfile</tt>.
The <tt>cat</tt> command shows the contents of one or more files.  The output
of <tt>cat</tt>, like any other command, may be redirected.  The three commands
below show the contents of <tt>myfile</tt>, copy the contents of

<tt>myfile</tt> to <tt>yourfile</tt>, and show the contents of both <tt>myfile</tt>
and <tt>yourfile</tt> concatenated together (hence the name <tt>cat</tt>).
<br><br><br>
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cat myfile</b>

   <i>Mon Sep 19 10:56:51 EDT 2011</i>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cat myfile > yourfile</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cat myfile yourfile</b>
   <i>Mon Sep 19 10:56:51 EDT 2011</i>
   <i>Mon Sep 19 10:56:51 EDT 2011</i>

   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
<tt><b>cat</b></tt>, like many commands, can take its input from the <i>standard
input</i>.
The first <tt>cat</tt> command below takes two lines of input from the keyboard
and puts them in the file <tt>theirfile</tt>.
Using the keyboard it is necessary to type the two lines and in addition
to indicate the end of input by typing ^D (D with the control key held down).
The second <tt>cat</tt> command shows the contents of the newly created
file.
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cat > theirfile</b>
   <b>the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
   now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party</b>
   ^D
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cat theirfile</b>
   <i>the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
   now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party</i>

   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
Standard input may also be redirected from a file using <b>&lt;</b> (a 'less than' sign):
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cat &lt; myfile</b>
   <i>Mon Sep 19 10:56:51 EDT 2011</i>

   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
<p><i>Note:  Be sure to use </i><tt>^D</tt> <i>to indicate the end of input,
not </i><tt>^Z</tt><i> as with Windows. If you use </i><tt>^Z</tt><i>, you'll
suspend the cat command and it will stay suspended until you use the </i>
<tt>fg</tt><i>
command to start it up again.  These facilities are examples of Unix <b>job control</b>.</i>

<h3>Manipulating files and directories</h3>
<tt>ls</tt> lists the names of the files that you have created, in addition to some
files automatically created by the system.  <tt>rm</tt> removes (deletes) a file immediately
and forever <i>but there are periodic backups in case you delete your life's work</i>.
<tt>cp</tt> copies a file and <tt>mv</tt> moves (renames) a file.
<pre>

   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>ls</b>
   <i>bin       cs241           myfile        theirfile     yourfile</i>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>rm theirfile</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cp myfile zip</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>mv zip zap</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>ls</b>
   <i>bin       cs241           myfile        yourfile      zap</i>

   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>

<p>You will probably want to organize your files into different directories, instead of
leaving everything in the default home directory. Each time you enroll in a CS course,
a directory for that course is automatically created. You can use the <tt>cd</tt>
command to change to your personal cs241 directory:
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>cd cs241</b>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241></i>
</pre>
This directory is a convenient place to store all the files you create for the course.
You can organize things further by using the <tt>mkdir</tt> command to make new directories.
For example, suppose you want to create a directory to store all the files for the first
assignment:
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241></i> <b>mkdir A1</b>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241></i> <b>cd A1</b>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241/A1></i>
</pre>
When you're finished working on Assignment 1, you can change back to your home directory.
In Unix, <tt><b>..</b></tt> refers to the directory "above" your current working directory.
So simply type <tt>cd ..</tt> twice:
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241/A1></i> <b>cd ..</b>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241></i> <b>cd ..</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
Alternatively, <b>~</b> refers to the home directory. So from anywhere in the system, you can
type <tt>cd ~</tt> to return to your home directory.

<pre>
   <i>linux028:~/cs241/A1/P1/solutions/attempt279></i> <b>cd ~</b>
   <i>linux028:~></i>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Copying files between computers</h3>
If you are working from your own computer (do remember to always use the CSCF Unix
environments to create files and test your solutions!) you can easily copy files back and
forth using the <tt>scp</tt> command. This should be done from your computer's Unix
environment <i>(on Windows, you will need to download an SCP client or install Cygwin)</i>.
The format of the command is <tt>scp PathToFile PathToTargetDir</tt>. You
can perform host-machine to server copying, server to host-machine copying, and
server to server copying with the <tt>scp</tt> command. To specify a server name, use
the format <tt>userid@host</tt>. To specify a file path within the host, use a
colon to separate the userid@host from the file path.

<pre>
   <i>freds-computer:~></i> <b>ls</b>
   <i>bin       cs241           myfile        yourfile      zap</i>
   <i>freds-computer:~></i> <b>scp myfile fred@linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca:~/cs241/</b>
   <i>fred@student.cs.uwaterloo.ca's password:</i>

   <i>myfile                                    100%  185     0.2KB/s   00:00</i>
   <i>freds-computer:~></i> <b>scp fred@linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca:~/cs241/myfile ./</b>
   <i>fred@student.cs.uwaterloo.ca's password:</i>

   <i>myfile                                    100%  185     0.2KB/s   00:00</i>
</pre>
In the first example, you are first copying <tt>myfile</tt> to Fred's CS account,
fred@student.cs.uwaterloo.ca, and placing it in the directory <tt>~/cs241/</tt>.
In the second example, you are copying <tt>myfile</tt> from the directory <tt>~/cs241/</tt>
on Fred's CS account, to the directory <tt>./</tt>.
(In Unix, <b>.</b> refers to your current working directory.)

<h3>Editors</h3>
You can create and edit files using <tt>evim</tt>.  The command below starts the
<tt>evim</tt> editor in a new window to edit the file <tt>myfile</tt>.
You can type text into the <tt>evim</tt> window and there are icons and menus to do all the
things you've become accustomed to like cut and paste, printing, and so on.
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>evim myfile &amp;</b>
</pre>
<p><i><tt>evim</tt> is a dumbed-down version of <tt>gvim</tt>.  <tt>gvim</tt> a graphical
version of the character-based editor <tt>vim</tt>.  <tt>vim</tt> is an extended
version of the standard Unix editor <tt>vi</tt>.  <tt>vi</tt>

has very powerful command and macro facilities, and is the prefered editor of many
serious programmers.  But those accustomed to Windows-based editors may find it
weird.  <tt>evim</tt> removes the weirdness at the expense of being incompatible.
<tt>gvim</tt> is compatible and so requires you hit the <tt>i</tt> key before
inserting text in the file.  (If you start gvim and hit <tt>i</tt>
it behaves pretty much the same way as evim until you hit esc.  Then
if you hit <tt>i</tt> again it behaves like <tt>evim</tt> again.)</i></p>
<p><i><tt>evim</tt> and <tt>gvim</tt> are graphical programs that run in a separate
window from the terminal. Thus, as explained in the SSH section, you will need to include
the -Y flag when you run the <tt>ssh</tt> command to be able to use these windowed programs. If you
are having trouble running them, you will have to use an editor that runs in the terminal such
as <tt>vim</tt>, <tt>emacs</tt> or <tt>pico</tt>. <tt>pico</tt> is the simplest of the
three to use, but also the least powerful.</i></p>

<h3>Email, Newsgroups and the Web</h3>
You will need to read email, newsgroups and web pages for this course's
work.  You will also need to use the web in order to submit your
assignments.  <tt>mozilla</tt> does all of these things; to start
<tt>mozilla</tt>:
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>mozilla &amp;</b>
</pre>

<p><i>Like <tt>evim</tt> and <tt>gvim</tt>, <tt>mozilla</tt> runs in a window, so you will
need to enable X11 forwarding by giving the -Y option to ssh. If you don't want to run
windowed programs, you can use the terminal programs <tt>w3m</tt> to browse the web and
<tt>alpine</tt> to read email and news. If you only need to use a web browser to submit
assignments, the
<a href=http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/marmoset_submit/><tt>marmoset_submit</tt></a>
 script is much easier to use than <tt>w3m</tt>
or <tt>mozilla</tt>.</i></p>

To read mail and news, click
the envelope icon near the bottom left of the Mozilla window.  The
first time you do this you'll have to answer some questions:
<ul>
<li>New Account Setup:  <i>Email account</i>
<li>Identity:  <i>your name and UW email address</i>
<li>Server Information:
<ul><li>select IMAP
<li>Incoming Server:  mailservices.uwaterloo.ca
<li>Outgoing Server:  mailservices.uwaterloo.ca
</ul>
<li>Incoming User Name:  <i>(your uw userid)</i>
<li>Enter your password:  <i>(your login password)</i>

</ul>
<p><i>(If "mailservices.uwaterloo.ca" does not work, your email account may be on a different
server. You will have to figure out the correct server information on your own. It is most
likely somewhere on your department/faculty's website.)</i></p>

<p>Then you'll get a mail/news window.  In this window, click your email
address in the left panel.  In the right panel, under <tt>Accounts</tt>
click <tt>Create a new account</tt>.
This time:
<ul>
<li>New Account Setup:  <i>Newsgroup account</i>
<li>Identity:  <i>your name and UW email address</i>
<li>Newsgroup server:  news.math
<li>Account Name:  news.math

</ul>
In the left panel of your news window click <tt>news.math</tt> and in the
right panel click <tt>Manage newsgroup subscriptions</tt>.  Find <tt>uw.cs.cs241</tt>
and any other newsgroups you want to read and click <tt>Subscribe</tt> then <tt>OK</tt>.
Now you can read your mail by clicking <tt>Inbox</tt> on the left panel and you
can read the newsgroup by clicking <tt>uw.cs.cs241</tt> in the same panel.

<p><i>
If you already use another program to read email and news, feel free to continue.
Make sure that you do receive and read mail addressed to your UW account!
You can browse the web from home, too, but you might have trouble submitting your
assignments from home if they are on a UW computer!</i></p>
<h3>Course-Specific Tools</h3>
Special Unix commands are required for some of your assignments.
Usage of the tools will be described with the assignments that require them.
Before using these commands you must enable them by entering:
<pre>
   <i>linux028:~></i> <b>source /u/cs241/setup</b>
</pre>
<p><i>You must re-enter this command whenever you log out and log in again.  You can automate this process by using <tt>evim</tt> to edit the file named <tt>.cshrc</tt>
You need to insert this line immediately before the second-last <tt>endif</tt>
in the file.  If you screw up this file, bad things will happen.</i>
<h3>Marmoset Automatic Grading System</h3>
All assignments will be submitted electronically by using a Web browser to
access the Marmoset system.  A link to Marmoset may be found on the
course web page.

<p>Alternatively, you can use the <tt><b>marmoset_submit</b></tt> command line tool to
submit assignments. It is much easier and faster than doing it through a web browser.
You need to run the <tt><b>source /u/cs241/setup</b></tt> command before <tt>marmoset_submit</tt>
will be available. A more complete tutorial is here:
<a href=http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/marmoset_submit/>
http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/marmoset_submit/</a></p>

<p>
To use Marmoset, log in using your WatIAM/Quest user id and password.
Marmoset displays a table of "Projects" -- each question in each assignment
is treated as a separate project.  Use the link in the column titled
<tt>project</tt> to view the assignment specification; use the link in the
column titled <tt>submissions</tt> to view the status and grade for any
previous submissions you have made for this project; use the link in the
column labeled <tt>web submission</tt> to submit a file for testing.  When
you click <tt>submit</tt> a page will open to allow you to type or select
the name of your file containing your submission.</p>
<p>
Your submission will immediately be run on a set of public tests; these results
should be available quite quickly -- you must refresh the view screen to see
the scores when they are available.</p>
<p>
If your submission succeeds on the public tests you will be invited to submit
for release testing; that is, for actual grading.  You will be informed as to
which of the release tests your program passes, but no details.  If you fail
some tests you should debug your submission and resubmit.  There is no penalty
for resubmission, but to encourage you to start early and to discourage you
from stabbing in the dark you are restricted to three release tests per project
per day.</p>
